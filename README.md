# Spam-Email-Classifier-using-Naive-Bayes

Goal is to design such a spam filter that can be used in the real-world easily to tag emails as spam or not spam. As you might have seen in your mail inboxes, few e-mails automatically get tagged/dumped into the Spam section. In this notebook, I explore how this filter is made. In order to do this, I require some data beforehand containing both spam and not spam e-mails using which I will be able to train a classifier. The classifier can then be used on new unseen mail texts to determine if they are spam or not spam.

The dataset I use for this contains 5,728 different mails (text) along with their tag- spam or not spam.
